            <h2>We follow system development life cycle approach</h2>
            <p>The software development process requires a chronological systematic approach to be conducted. To execute any web or
            software development project we follow a system development life cycle approach.</p>

                <h5>Planning stage
</h5>
                <p>This starts with a planning stage, where we examine the feasibility of the project. The practice of this stage ensures
                the objective if there are any errors that may affect later, ensuring funding according to the project plan, and
                schedule and responsibility allocation among the team members.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sp-box-service">
                <h5>Analysis stage
</h5>
                <p>Followed by the first stage, the analysis stage includes collecting all the specific details required for the project.
                The process may require making any prototype system and evaluating alternatives to the existing one. Conducting research
                and then analyzing the client’s demand comes by the end. We maintain a software requirement specification (SRS) document
                to keep our whole plan clear.
</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sp-box-service">
                <h5>Design & prototyping
</h5>
                <p>At the design stage, we outline the details of planning the product. We call this prototyping. Our developers get a
                clear idea of user and system interface, database and network requirements at this stage.
</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sp-box-service">
                <h5>Development and bug fixing
</h5>
                <p>Based on the outlined designs and specifications, developers write codes at this stage. Finally, the web application or
                software gets developed at this point. After developing the application, we conduct testing to find out bugs and make
                corrections within a given time frame. Within this time frame, re-fixing of the written code may take place several
                times. Until the developer team confirms zero flaws, we don’t move on to the next segment.
</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sp-box-service">
                <h5>Implementation and integration stage
</h5>
                <p>Next, the implementation and integration stage comes. At this stage, we integrate the designs into the finalized source
                code. In case any mismatch or errors occur at this point we again go for re-fixing the code or the conduct needed
                changes in design and models.

                <h5>Delivery & post service</h5>
                <p>Finally, the product is ready to hand over to its end-user. Though most of the time our service tends to continue even
                after delivery. Mostly a great deal of changes occurs when the end-user implements the application or software for real
                practices.</p>
